                    <p class="about-p">
                        I began learning how to write code in 2018. 
                        Since then I've served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, for two years, 
                        in both Sydney Australia and Las Vegas Nevada, and I now attend BYU in Provo, UT. I'm a computer engineering 
                        major, scheduled to graduate in the spring of 2025. I love to learn, and it's one of the things that adds to 
                        my abilities as a developer. In high school, I finished all my general education classes and graduated with 
                        an Associate's Degree. I was named the Provo High School Mathematics Sterling Scholar, graduated with a 4.0 GPA, 
                        was the salutatorian, and earned a 35/36 on the ACT.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I have many other hobbies outside of software development. I enjoy being active by hiking with my wife, Nikki, and 
                        playing basketball. I love listening to music, especially by the Las Vegas band The Killers, and I 
                        often make covers of other artist's songs at home with my piano. In fact, my first major web-programming 
                        project was focused on my love of The Killers and my own ability to make music.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I want to be the best programmer I can. Although I believe that a good work-life balance is important, 
                        I often get caught up for hours working on projects, researching technology, and watching videos about development in 
                        my free time. I believe in going above and beyond. For example, with my Killers Project, which was a capstone for a 
                        DevMountain bootcamp I was involved in, I taught myself React, React Router, and TailwindCSS. 
                        I put in well over 150 hours of my own free time on that project over the course of five weeks, 
                        even though the capstone requirements expected only html/vanilla JS & CSS, and 3 working features.
